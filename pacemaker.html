    <h2>About Pacemaker</h1>
    <h3>WHAT is P A C E M A K E R ?</h3>
    <p>
      A cardiac pacemaker is a small device that helps the heart beat more evenly. Natural Heart Pacemaker (SA Node) is a small mass of specialized cells in the top of the heart's right atrium (upper chamber). It initiates and generates the electrical impulses that cause your heart to beat. If something prevents the pacemaker cells from doing their job, the heart may not beat normally. The doctors may then put in a man-made pacemaker made up of electrodes (thin flexible wires) and a generator (battery).
    </p>

    <h3>Why is a Heart Pacemaker required?</h3>
    <p>
      A Heart Pacemaker is used to stabilize dangerously slow heart beats (bradycardia) (less than 60 beats per minute). Slow heart beats can result from metabolic abnormalities, blocked arteries to the heart's conduction system, Sick Sinus Syndrome or SA node dysfunction (commonly caused by congenital heart defects, illnesses, cardiotoxic drugs, the natural aging process, or scar tissue from a heart attack), heart block or cardiac surgery. Because of this, the heart is not able to meet the body's demands, resulting in symptoms such as dizziness, extreme fatigue, shortness of breath, or fainting spells. Whatever the cause of symptomatic bradycardia, a pacemaker can keep the heart beating at a rate that allows to continue living a normal life.

    <h3>What are the different kinds of Heart Pacemakers?</h3>
    <p>
      Heart Pacemaker can be:
    </p>
    <h4>Permanent (internal) Heart Pacemaker</h4>
    <p>
      This kind of Heart Pacemaker is implanted in a small pocket under your skin and is meant to be left in there for the rest of your life.
    </p>
    <h4>Demand Heart Pacemaker</h4>
    <p>
      This kind of Heart Pacemaker has an inbuilt sensing device which senses when the heart beat is too slow and turns the signal on. Once the heart beat is above a certain level, it automatically turns the signal off.
    </p>
    <h4>Single Chamber Heart Pacemaker - <h4>
    <p>
      This kind of device has one lead to carry signals to and from one chamber of your heart, either the right atrium or, more commonly, the right ventricle.
    </p>
    <h4>Dual Chamber Heart Pacemaker</h4>
