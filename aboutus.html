    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of establishing KK Nursing Home came in the mind of Dr. K P Rama, MBBS, DTM a renowned physician of Bihar in December 1978 when he realized the need of having a secondary care hospital for the people in and around Bhagalpur. His aim was to provide quality medical care for poor rural population at a very affordable cost. For the first time in district of Bhagalpur a medical indoor facility was offered to common people. He started the concept of treatment while being admitted.

      He was joined by his two sons : Dr.  B. K. Sinha a post graduate surgeon trained in U. K. and  Dr. A. K. Sinha  a Physician and cardiologist trained in UK and USA. Dr. A. K. Sinha did his residency in  New Jersey , USA  and was awarded Whoâ€™s  Who in New Jersey in 1975 for his outstanding work in Cardiology.
